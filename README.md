# Project-8
Loading Data: Import data into your working environment using appropriate libraries (e.g., pandas in Python).
Data Cleaning :
     Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values by imputation or removal. • Removing Duplicates: Remove duplicate rows to ensure data quality.
Data Transformation :
         Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into a numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.  
Scaling: 
          Standardize numerical variables to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Data Visualization :
        Visualize the distribution of a single variable. • Box Plots: Identify the spread and outliers in a single variable. Scatter Plots Visualize the relationship between two * numerical variables. • Pair Plots: Explore relationships between multiple variables.
Data Drop: 
       Dropping data refers to removing rows or columns from a dataset, often to eliminate irrelevant or redundant information.
Data Unique:
       Finding unique values in a dataset helps identify distinct categories or entities within the data.
Data Types (Data Dtypes): Understanding the data types of variables in a dataset is essential for proper data manipulation and analysis.
Skewness: A measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.
Matrix: A rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns, often used to represent data or transformations.
Outliers: Data points that significantly differ from other observations in a dataset.
Scatterplot: A type of plot that displays values for two variables as points on a Cartesian plane, where each axis represents one variable.
